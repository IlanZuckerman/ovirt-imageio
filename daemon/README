ovirt-imageio-daemon
==================

Overview
--------

ovirt-imageio-daemon provides direct access to oVirt disks using HTTPS
protocol.  Together with ovirt-imageio-proxy, it allows uploading a disk
image directly into an oVirt disk, downloading an oVirt disk, or
performing random I/O.

The goal is to keep ovirt-imageio-daemon simple as possible. We use a
single protocol (HTTP) for everything, and avoid dependencies on Vdsm.

This daemon provides these services:

- images service    read and write data to/from images. This service is
                    available via HTTPS on port 54322. This service is
                    accessed by ovirt-imageio-proxy or directly by
                    clients.

- tickets service   manage tickets authorizing images service
                    operations. Available localy via HTTP over unix
                    domain socket. Vdsm is using this service to add,
                    remove, and extend tickets per ovirt-engine
                    request.

- progress service  report progress for ongoing images operations.
                    Available locally via HTTP over unix domain socket.
                    Vdsm will access this to report progress to Engine.
