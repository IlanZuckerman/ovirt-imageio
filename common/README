ovirt-image-common
==================

Overview
--------

ovirt-image-common provides common functionality for ovirt projects related to
ovirt images- such as VDSM, and other ovirt-imageio projects- "ovirt-image-daemon"
and "ovirt-image-proxy".

This project includes the following common modules:

web.py
------
A web application infrastructure for web application projects to use. the module
supplies an "Application" class, which can get multiple handlers for HTTP method
calls. This module is being used by ovirt-image-daemon and ovirt-image-proxy: web
applications for ovirt images transferring. (See README file in each project for
more details)

directio.py
-----------
A module for doing direct I/O from a stream source to a destination file in the
system. This module is being used by VDSM for fetching VM disks from a remote source
using libvirt's API, and by ovirt-image-daemon for I/O of oVirt's disks by its clients.
