If you want to suggest a fix or improvement, please post a patch to this
file, and discuss the change in ovirt devel mailing list.


Must

- Implement io operations in a separate process, so inaccessible storage
  cannot cause the while process to get stuck.

- Support Range and Content-Range headers so uploading and downloading
  partial content is possible

- Break into small modues, eliminating globals. Access global state (such
  as tickets/sessions) using functions.

- Configuration file - simple ini file should be fine, check what is
  conf.d system suggested by Alon.

- Packaging

- CI scripts

Maybe

- Scale/stress tests

- Use autoconf for default settings (e.g /var/run/vdsm/vdsm-imaged.sock)

- Use server supporting multiple sockets, or implement such listener,
  passing connected sockets to actual http server (similar to
  protocoldetector in vdsm).

- Eliminate polling for shutdown - easily solved if we support multiple
  sockets, just add a pipe or eventfd for signaling shutdown.

- Daemonizing support for system without systemd.
